Because this was written using Expo, to deploy, you must make a web build using the command: 'expo build:web'
You also need to run this command everytime you want to redeploy

Install the dependencies for expo for your app: 'npm install -D expo-cli'

And add a file named 'Procfile' with the singe line of code: 'web: npx serve web-build'
